To create the covariance figures observed in the R9 / R10 Methylation analysis
paper, execute the Covariance_direct on each dataset (R9 HG002, R10 HG002, 
R9 PPMI, R10 PPMI, R9 NABEC, R10 NABEC). Then feed the output .tsv files to the
figures script.

Note: The analysis in the paper was only for chr21, + strand. Reducing the number of
sites to computational inefficiencies.
